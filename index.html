                        Education helps to build character as you learn about different cultures, languages and how
                        other people think as well as live. When you have an education you are able to fulfill the basic
                        needs in life. You are taught to get dressed, learn self-care and practical life skills.</p>

            <p class="text-big">The quality of education is certainly very important for the younger generation. Our
                generation of youth are going to be the ones to lead the country forward. When young people do not get
                adequate high-quality education, then we will be left behind other nations. Where’s the importance
                placed in education? The benefits of education is to improve the minds and achievements of the younger
                generation, so that they will be able to compete in a cutthroat global market.</p>

            <p class="text-big">Modern education is very different from the traditional education. Modern education
                teaches about the skills required today that is the skills of science and technology, science of medical
                science etc. In addition to listening, the modern education includes writing, visualizing, imagining,
                and thinking skills.</p>

            <h1 class="head1">Science, Technology And Innovation!</h1>
            <p class="text-big">Linking the words “science,” “technology,” and “innovation,” may suggest that we know
                more about how these activities are related than we really do. This very common linkage implicitly
                conveys a linear progression from scientific research to technology creation to innovative products.
                More nuanced pictures of these complex activities break them down into components that interact with
                each other in a multi-dimensional socio-technological-economic network. A few examples will help to make
                this clear.</p>
